# SkillHub: A Collaborative Learning and Training Platform

## 1. Vision & Business Context

SkillHub is a **digital learning ecosystem** that connects **trainers**, **learners**, and **organizations** through a shared platform.
The system supports **live training sessions**, **course marketplaces**, **certification workflows**, and **performance analytics** — all built on **domain-driven, microservice-based architecture**.

Your role as the **Solution Architect** is to **define the domain, identify subdomains, design bounded contexts, and map them to microservices**.
Then, outline aggregates, events, and integration strategies for a production-scale implementation.

## 2. Core Business Goals

1. Allow trainers to create and manage **courses, sessions, and certifications**.
2. Enable learners to **enroll in courses, complete lessons, and earn certificates**.
3. Support organizations to **track employee learning paths and compliance training**.
4. Provide **analytics and recommendations** for learners and managers.
5. Ensure a **secure, auditable, and scalable** system supporting multi-tenant access.
